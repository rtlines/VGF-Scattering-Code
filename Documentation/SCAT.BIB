From this dispersion relation we obtain a perscription for choosing dipole polarizabilites so that an infinite latice with finite lattice spacing will mimic a continuum with dielectric constant \eps(\omega). The Discrete Dipole Approximation is used to calculate scatering and absorption by a finite target by re;lacing the target with an array of point dipoles. We compare different prescriptions for determining the dipole polarizabilities. We show that the most accurate results are obtained when the lattice dispersion relation is used to set the plarizabilities.},

Computational consiterations - use of complex conjugate gradient algorithms and fast fourier transform methods - are discussed. The accuracy of the DDA is tested by using the DDA to compute scattering and absorption by isolated, homogenous spheres, as well as for targets consisting of two contiguous spheres. It is shown that for dielectric naterials (|m|<=2), the DDA permits calculation of scattering and absorption which are accurate to within a few %.},

@article{Purcell,
abstract = {A method is described for calculation approximate extinction, absorption, and scattering cross-sections for dielectric grains of arbitrary shape, with dimensions comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of the incident radiation. The grain is modeled by an array of N polarizable elements in vacuum. The elements are located on a simple cubic lattice, and N is of order of magnitude 100. The polarizability of an element is such that an unbounded array would exhibit, according to the Clausius-Mossotti relation, the bulk dielectric constant of the grain material. The complex vecto amplitude of each oscillator in the array, which is driven by the field of the incident wave and the fields of all the other oscillators, is determined by an itterative procedure. From the N amplitudes all the cross-sections, including differential cross-sections, are obtained. The method was tested by comparing the cross-sections computed for "spherical" clusters of oscillators with exact Mie theroy values for the corresponding dielectric spheres. Computed cross-sections are presented for five differeent grain shapes and theree different complex refractive indices.},

The forms of the matrices obtained for several types of scatterers are found to be in exact agreement with those predicted by symmetry. The method is tested quantitatively by comprison with Mie predictions for solid and coated spheres and good agreement is observed. This comoparison is also used to establish apporpriate magnitudes for anisotropic sipolar polarizabilities.},
